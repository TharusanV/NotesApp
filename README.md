### Description :
Created this repository initially as a playground to test the functional and user-interface related areas of my component 'Note Creator' for my Year 2 Group Project (problem statement for the project below) without affecting the main repository. With that being said, although 'EduNotes' (name of our project) is a Full-Stack web application through the use of MySQL and Java SpringBoot this repo doesn't have a back-end, but as I have all the code for the back-end already may use something like FireBase if I want to in the future but we will see.
